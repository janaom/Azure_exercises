The first step in using Azure Storage is to provision an Azure Storage account in your Azure subscription.

    If you haven't already done so, sign into the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com. Then on the Azure portal home page, select ï¼‹ Create a resource from the upper left-hand corner and search for Storage account. Then in the resulting Storage account page, select Create.

    Enter the following values on the Create a storage account page:
        Subscription: If you're using a sandbox, select Concierge Subscription. Otherwise, select your Azure subscription.
        Resource group: If you're using a sandbox, select the existing resource group (which will have a name like learn-xxxx...). Otherwise, create a new resource group with a name of your choice.
        Storage account name: Enter a unique name for your storage account using lower-case letters and numbers.
        Region: Select any available location.
        Performance: Standard
        Redundancy: Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

    Select Next: Advanced > and view the advanced configuration options. In particular, note that this is where you can enable hierarchical namespace to support Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. Leave this option unselected (you'll enable it later), and then select Next: Networking > to view the networking options for your storage account.

    Select Next: Data protection > and then in the Recovery section, deselect all of the Enable soft delete... options. These options retain deleted files for subsequent recovery, but can cause issues later when you enable hierarchical namespace.

    Continue through the remaining Next > pages without changing any of the default settings, and then on the Review + Create page, wait for your selections to be validated and select Create to create your Azure Storage account.

    Wait for deployment to complete. Then go to the resource that was deployed.
