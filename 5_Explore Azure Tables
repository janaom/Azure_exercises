Azure Tables provide a key/value store for applications that need to store data values, but don't need the full functionality and structure of a relational database.

    In the Azure portal page for your storage container, on the left side, in the Data storage section, select Tables.

    On the Tables page, select ＋ Table and create a new table named products.

    After the products table has been created, in the pane on the left side, in the top section, select Storage browser (preview).

    In storage explorer, select Tables and verify that the products table is listed.

    Select the products table.

    In the product page, select ＋ Add entity.

    In the Add entity panel, enter the following key values:
        PartitionKey: 1
        RowKey: 1

    Select Add property, and create a new property with the following values:
    Property name 	Type 	Value
    Name 	String 	Widget

    Add a second property with the following values:
    Property name 	Type 	Value
    Price 	Double 	2.99

    Select Insert to insert a row for the new entity into the table.

    In storage browser, verify that a row has been added to the products table, and that a Timestamp column has been created to indicate when the row was last modified.

    Add another entity to the products table with the following properties:
    Property name 	Type 	Value
    PartitionKey 	String 	1
    RowKey 	String 	2
    Name 	String 	Kniknak
    Price 	Double 	1.99
    Discontinued 	Boolean 	true

    After inserting the new entity, verify that a row containing the discontinued product is shown in the table.

    You have manually entered data into the table using the storage browser interface. In a real scenario, application developers can use the Azure Storage Table API to build applications that read and write values to tables, making it a cost effective and scalable solution for NoSQL storage.
